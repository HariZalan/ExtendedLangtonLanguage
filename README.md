# ExtendedLangtonLanguage
ExtendedLangtonLanguage is a planned programming language operating on a black-and-white board with three instructions and one „operator” moving through it. This repository contains a mere description yet, the actual implementations (first in PHP, second in C) will come in one to two months.

The operator starts from [0,0], turning towards [1,0]. When it leaves a field, if tha field has been white, turns black, and vice versa. There are threee commands: l, r and c. „l” turns left and moves forward; „r” turns right and moves forward; „c” turns left if the actually occupied field is black, right otherwise. An initial board can be given arbitrarily. As Langton's ant is Turing-complete, and this is an extended version (with l and r), ExtendedLangtonLanguage is Turing-complete as well.
